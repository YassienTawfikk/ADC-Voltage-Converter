# ADC Representation and Conversion

This repository contains a Python program for simulating an Analog-to-Digital Converter (ADC). The program allows you to specify the ADC resolution, define a voltage range, and simulate the ADCâ€™s behavior, including quantization and digital value representation.

## Features
- **Voltage Representation**: Display all possible voltage levels and their corresponding binary representations based on the specified ADC resolution.
- **Voltage Conversion**: Convert a user-input voltage to its closest digital equivalent, showing the corresponding voltage reference and quantization error.

## How It Works
1. The user inputs the number of bits for the ADC resolution.
2. The user defines the minimum and maximum voltage range for the ADC.
3. The program calculates the step size and displays all possible voltage levels and their binary representations.
4. The user provides an input voltage to be converted, and the program outputs the corresponding binary value, the closest voltage reference, and the quantization error.
